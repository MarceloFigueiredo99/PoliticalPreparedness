# PoliticalPreparedness

To test this project, please create a project using google cloud console, that has access to [Google Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information?hl=pt-br). After that, you must set the value of the variable API_KEY (CivicsHttpClient.kt) to your own api key.
Compile the project and you're good to go :)
